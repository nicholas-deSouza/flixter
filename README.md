### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics in my lab did prepare me to complete this assignment, specifically calling APIs. A feature that I felt unprepared to complete was more of the CSS aspect of it since the way I was able to get the grid view was very specific and it was something I hadn't heard of or used before.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would've focused more on the optional features and improving the overall styling of the webpage.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, my project demo went well. Unfortunately I wasn't able to have the grid view ready for the demo but I was able to get that fixed soon afterwards. I noticed that a peer of mine was able to embed videos from YouTube and that's something I'd like to try if I had more time.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I'd like to give a shoutout to my group today, Susan and Diego. They were both a lot of help, specifically Diego, he was able to help me debug my search function and was very patient with me.
